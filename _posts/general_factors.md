# A guide to General Factors

*TL;DR:* 
In complex systems, such as the body, mind and society many things tend to vary together. 
Often, that’s not a coincidence: a few upstream constraints (general factors) or strongly interlinked networks drive a lot of downstream behavior. 
The most know example of which appears in psychology: "g" factor (general intelligence). 
Others exist as well: In psychiatry, it’s the “p” factor. In physiology and health it’s aging, chronic inflammation, and fitness; in society, Socioeconomic Status, social capital, or technology (TFP). 
If one wants to maximize his or her impact on the world spotting wether a general factor is in play helps identify where the real leverage lives.
