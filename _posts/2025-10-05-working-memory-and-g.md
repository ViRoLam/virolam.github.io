When talking about working memory we first need to explain what we mean by memory and what working means in this context ? 

In most articles about the subject you will find that people describe working memory as a sort of canvas of the mind; as the workspace in which mental representations are encoded, held in mind, transformed, and filtered. It is subject to volontary cognitive control, meaning that you an "consciously" attend and change these mental representations.


## Attention and working memory 



## Methods Notes
Inline math like $d'$, $\alpha$, or $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$; display math:

$$
g \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{WM} + \epsilon
