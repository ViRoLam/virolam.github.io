## Overview
Working memory (WM) capacity correlates strongly with general intelligence ($g$). Evidence suggests WM may serve as a bottleneck for fluid reasoning.

### Key Evidence
- Classic dual-task WM paradigms.
- Latent-variable models relating WM to $g$.[@conway2003]
- Network-level associations (fronto-parietal control).

## Methods Notes
Inline math like $d'$, $\alpha$, or $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$; display math:

$$
g \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{WM} + \epsilon
$$
